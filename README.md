# HTML Basics - Odin Project
This project is a demonstration of basic HTML skills as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The project includes the use of lists, headings, and links in HTML.

# Introduction
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is the backbone of any web page, and it is responsible for the structure and content of the page.

# HTML Basics
HTML uses tags to define elements in a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and they tell the web browser how to display the content of the page. HTML elements can be used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more. Each element has a specific purpose and is used to structure the content of the page.

# HTML Elements Used
- Headings: HTML headings are used to define the structure of a web page. There are six different levels of headings, ranging from <h1> to <h6>. The <h1> tag represents the most important heading, while the <h6> tag represents the least important heading.
- Paragraphs: HTML paragraphs are used to group together text content. The <p> tag is used to create a new paragraph.
- Lists: HTML lists are used to group together related items. There are two types of lists in HTML: ordered lists and unordered lists. Ordered lists use the <ol> tag, while unordered lists use the <ul> tag.
- Links: HTML links are used to create hyperlinks between different web pages. The <a> tag is used to create a new link.
- Images: The HTML <img> tag is used to display images on a web page. It requires a source attribute (src) that specifies the URL or file path of the image file. The img tag can also include optional attributes such as alt text, width, height, and style.

# What Have I Learned
Overall, this was a great learning experience, mainly on Git honestly. I am happy with the result, and I sincerely hope you, as the reader/user, will be too! It was fun to practice different HTML elements, and I can't wait to progress further in The Odin Project curriculum! Thank you for reading!
