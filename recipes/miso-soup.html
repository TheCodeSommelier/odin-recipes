    <!-- Short decription of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Miso soup is a traditional Japanese dish that's simple, healthy, and
      bursting with umami flavors. It typically consists of a savory broth made
      from dashi (a Japanese soup stock), mixed with miso paste and a variety of
      ingredients such as tofu, seaweed, and scallions. The result is a
      comforting and satisfying soup that can be enjoyed as a light meal or a
      warm appetizer. With a few simple ingredients and easy steps, you can
      easily make your own delicious miso soup at home.
