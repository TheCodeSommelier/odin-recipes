    </ul>

    <!-- These are the steps people need to take in order to have thei marshmallows -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place 1/3 cup cornstarch and 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a</li>
      <li>
        Lightly coat an 8x8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Use a
        paper towel to wipe the pan and make sure there's a thin film on every
        surface, corner, and side. Place about 1/4 cup of the powdered sugar
        mixture in a fine-mesh strainer, then use it to generously coat the
        sides and bottom of the pan. Flip the pan over and tap out the excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shake 1 (about 15-ounce) can chickpeas before opening. Pour off 1/2 cup
        of the canning liquid (known as aquafaba) into the bowl of a stand mixer
        (or large bowl if using an electric hand mixer). Save the remaining
        chickpeas and liquid for another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 cup water and 2 teaspoons agar-agar powder in a medium saucepan.
        Bring to a boil over high heat, whisking continuously until the powder
        is dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring
        occasionally, until very slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add 2 cups
        granulated sugar and whisk vigorously until dissolved with no lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium high and let return to a boil without
        stirring. Reduce the heat to medium. Once large bubbles start to form at
        the edges and the center starts to froth, boil for 5 minutes (the
        temperature will be 225℉ to 230℉). Meanwhile, add 1/4 teaspoon cream of
        tartar, 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum, and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt to the
        aquafaba (if you are adding food coloring, add a few drops at this stage
        to reach the desired color). Beat with the whisk attachment, start
        beating on low speed and gradually increasing to high speed, until stiff
        peaks form, and it looks similar to shaving cream, about 3 minutes
        total. Leave in the mixer.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the syrup is ready, remove the saucepan from the heat. Turn the
        stand mixer on to low speed. Very gradually drizzle the syrup down the
        sides of the bowl while slowly increasing the speed to medium-high
        (about 1 1/2 minutes), then continue to beat until glossy, fluffy, and
        voluminuous, about 5 minutes total from when you started adding the
        syrup. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula as needed. Add 4
        teaspoons vanilla extract and beat until combined, about 15 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly transfer the mixture to the baking pan. Spread evenly with an
        offset spatula or a bench scraper, making sure you get into the corners
        (as you spread, you may see tiny bumps, but this is trapped air). Firmly
        tap the pan a couple of times on the counter to disperse some of the air
        in the mixture; it can be common to get some tiny bubbles in the center
        of vegan marshmallows, so tapping the pan will help.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift 1 to 2 tablespoons of the powdered sugar mixture through a
        fine-mesh strainer over the marshamallows to lightly cover. Let the
        marshmallow slab sit uncovered at room temperature until fully set
        inside, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run an offset spatula or knife around the edges of the pan. Use a large,
        flat spatula to carefully lift the marshmallow slab out of the pan to
        loosen it. Flip the pan onto a cutting board so the slab is powdered
        sugar-side down. Sift another 1 to 2 tablespoons of the powdered sugar
        mixture over the marshamallow slab. Transfer the remaining powder to a
        large shallow bowl or plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sharp knife or pizza wheel, cut the marshmallows into 25 (1
        1/2-inch) squares, or cut to the size of your choice. Toss the
        marshmallows generously in the remaining powdered sugar mixture to coat
        all the sides. Sift the remaining powder mixture into airtight
        containers before stacking the marshmallows for storage. Use parchment
        paper to between the layers, dusting each layer as you stack.
